### üßÆ DAX Measures

```dax
// Median Sales Change by Region
Mediun Sales Change = 
VAR CurrMedianPrice = 
    MEDIANX(
        FILTER(Housing, YEAR(Housing[date]) = YEAR(MAX(Housing[date]))),
        Housing[purchase_price]
    )
VAR PrevMedianPrice = 
    MEDIANX(
        FILTER(Housing, YEAR(Housing[date]) = YEAR(MAX(Housing[date])) - 1),
        Housing[purchase_price]
    )
RETURN IF(PrevMedianPrice <> 0, (CurrMedianPrice - PrevMedianPrice) / PrevMedianPrice, BLANK())
```

```dax
// Units Sold in Latest Year & Quarter
Houses Sold on latest year and quarter = 
    CALCULATE(
        DISTINCTCOUNT(Housing[house_id]),
        YEAR(Housing[date]) = YEAR(MAX(Housing[date])) &&
        QUARTER(Housing[date]) = QUARTER(MAX(Housing[date]))
    )
```

```dax
// Sales in Last 12 Months
Last 12 months Sales = 
    CALCULATE(
        SUM(Housing[purchase_price]),
        DATESINPERIOD(Housing[date], MAX(Housing[date]), -12, MONTH)
    )
```

```dax
// YOY Sales Growth
YOY_SALES_GROWTH = 
VAR CurrYearSales = 
    CALCULATE(SUM(Housing[purchase_price]), YEAR(Housing[date]) = YEAR(MAX(Housing[date])))
VAR PrevYearSales = 
    CALCULATE(SUM(Housing[purchase_price]), YEAR(Housing[date]) = YEAR(MAX(Housing[date])) - 1)
RETURN IF(PrevYearSales <> 0, (CurrYearSales - PrevYearSales) / PrevYearSales, BLANK())
